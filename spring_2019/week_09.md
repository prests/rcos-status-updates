## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have finished documenting the project for future semesters. This is my final semester at RPI since I'm graduating and I really want this project to continue onwards. I believe that great documentation is the secret to any project succeeding. I learned a lot of new methodolgies in order to work in an Android Studio environment so I want to speed up that learning curve for new people.

## This Week's Plan

> I've been on and off doing coding and doing documenation

## Anything Blocking?

> This week is exam 2 for operating systems so a lot of my energy is being sent to that.

## Notes

> I keep saying I'm going back to the codebase but I keep running into other things that block me.
