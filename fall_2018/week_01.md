## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I worked on learning android studio and refamiliarizing myself with coding in java, because it's been a while. I followed youtube tutorials on test projects to learn more about linking the visual aspects with the actual code.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to begin class hierarchy, evaluate system design, and just keep getting better with android studio. We also want to get a Google Maps API key to mess around with that.

## Anything Blocking?

> No blocks right now.
