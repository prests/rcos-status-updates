## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I did not accomplish what I wanted to. I had a final project that took precident over coding for RCOS. However, I did do research into image handling within Android Studio. The package is called glide and it is new to me. You can use glide however to make really simple calls to get images back. After an image path is established with a website or filesystem you can then edit the image with the glide package.

## This Week's Plan

> My goal this week is to use the glide package to get images from our backend and complete the profile section of the fraternity page. If this doesn't take too much time I want to look into the calendar feature that is on the iOS application. This is a stretch goal and would just put the android app really far ahead in development

## Anything Blocking?

> New to glide and still need to know about multi threading the app for loading images

## Notes

> I need sleep
