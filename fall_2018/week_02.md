## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I worked on adding mock panels to represent clickables for fraternities that would lead to viewable bios about fraternities

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to work on setting up google maps API as well as uber's API

## Anything Blocking?

> We want all the API's to be centralized so we need to get the team's email/password/ect.

## Notes
