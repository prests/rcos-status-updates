## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked primarily on the user action logging and successfully can store information about which fraternity is getting viewed, which events are getting viewed, and when the application is sent to background and foreground. The information of who is doing the actions is anonymous, the data is purely for RushMe team and for IFC to see which fraternities are struggling.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to wrap up user action logging, and then address saving state in an application. Saving state may end up being next week's plan aswell if my Operating System's project takes too long

## Anything Blocking?

> In Android development there's an overide function for when an application goes to the background/foreground but it also gets called when you switch activities in the app, which is not what I want to have happen.
