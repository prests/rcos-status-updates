## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I did some work on the calendar for the Android application. We had a bug before that when I colored the number of events in a day it would color all the dates, so I fixed that. I also created a global class to store the events and fraternities because passing all the events through intents was too much data and would cause the application to crash. The goal of this is now to have access anywhere depending on the activity since its class based.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I am working on linking events to fraternity profile pages. The goal is to be able to click on an event and see all the details about the fraternity. This will use intents since only one fraternity will be passed.

## Anything Blocking?

> The person working on the XML files for the fraternity profile page hasn't finished so I can't link up everything between activities.
