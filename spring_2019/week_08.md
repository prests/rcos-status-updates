## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have been busy with a lot of Capstone work so not much has been done. I have begun to work on the new activity to view a list of all the fraternities at once for people to be able to pick by fraternities and not by events. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue working on this feature and hopefully be on the same level as the iPhone app

## Anything Blocking?

> For some reason the adapter that I attach to recycler view says that it's not attached even though it's done the same way as listing all the events.

## Notes

> I keep saying I'm going back to the codebase but I keep running into other things that block me.
