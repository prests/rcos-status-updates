## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This was a big week for myself on the Android Development for RushMe. I flushed out the skeleton class of fraternity so now you can create dynamice buttons by using these classes. Once we connect the backend to the frontend we can make all the active fraternities with live data instead of dummy data. I also learned about intents in android development. These intents are used when you want to navigate between pages (they're called activities in android). You can also add data to these intents called extras. I used this to pass data to the new profile activity page I created, so that is dynamic as well too. This is beneficial because now I don't need to make 29 different requests I just need to make one and then pass data for the respected fraternity.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to work on the actual page layout for the profile activity page. I want to have the layout similair to that of the iOS app. I don't want to work with pictures yet because that's different than just standard data types. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I need to learn how to code the xml layout. I was used to using the graphic user interface that android studio has to design, but this should be too hard to overcome. 

## Notes

> This is starting to actually get fun and I'm spending less time on stackoverflow!!
