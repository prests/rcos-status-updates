## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on linking the XML layouts created by another member of the RushMe team. This code is included whenever someone clicks on an event it will load a Fraternities detail page. My work included passing the fraternity from one event to the other using intents. I also had to setup the Fraternity class to be parceable which is a java extension because it's a custom class. Overall we now can view the details of any fraternity.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to incorporate pictures with the fraternity detail page. I want to load pictures on demand so we don't end up loading a crazy amount of photos and slowing down the application

## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers this week.
