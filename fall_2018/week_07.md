## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started working on looking into calls to the backend for the app. I've used aws before but it was a RESTful API which made calls to an EC2 instance that was linked to a Postgres RDS database. I've never used S3 so the calls will be different than before. I've also only delt with standard datatypes (Strings, Ints, Booleans) not pictures. I also wrapped up the transfer of data between  the main activity and the specific fraternity page, which looks a lot like the iOS app.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to learn more about s3 with android studio. I also have to learn about downloading images in the background because apparently if you don't the app will stop and wait until everything is downloaded.

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't know a lot about s3 or having something load in a different thread.

## Notes

> No notes this week. Hope break went well.
