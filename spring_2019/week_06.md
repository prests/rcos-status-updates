## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Since the semester is coming to an end and the Android application is in a stable state, our team has decided to do some documentation for people who work on this project in semesters to come. With that I drew up a system diagram for the Android application. That way new students who are new to Android Studio or new to this project can climb that learning curve a little bit faster and have a better understand of how all these classes, functions, and code work. This is also useful for us because we can use this to build when we ant to add new features. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I want to polish off the diagram and then go back to coding. In terms of coding I want to work on saving state so when someone actually follows an event it will save when they close and reopen the app.

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't know much about caching in android studio but from light research it seems very well documented!
