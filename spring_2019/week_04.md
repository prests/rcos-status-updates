## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week the team deployed a google play store account. While this is not a coding update it is a big update for the team. I joined RushMe last semester when it was just starting Android development. I've been working from the ground up since and this is awesome to see that we are close to releasing for Android soon. Other than that I commented and refactored the project so it will soon be ready for the Google Playstore

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to work on user action logging for the application. With this we will be able to see what fraternities are getting a lot of views and which events are getting a lot of likes. We also need to work on saving states and notifications before we try and go public

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't know how to save a state inbetween closing an app and starting it back up
