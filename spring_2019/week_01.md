## Last Week's Accomplishments

> So I worked on the RCOS project all during break where we made improvements to calls to the backend from the Android application. I also did work in styling for the calendar page so events look nicer. I also established environmental variables so rather than having to pass the same data multiple times I can just call these variables. I learned a lot about adapters in Android Studio and how to build custom XML layouts for more complex visuals. The adapters are really useful with layouts like listview and scrollview because you can dynamically change the data stored in them (i.e., clicking on a new date to a have a different list of events). 

## This Week's Plan

> This week I plan to make the XML layouts for the fraternity list. This will have custom views for seeing all the fraternities in a list. I also hope to implement favoriting so people can save fraternities they like.

## Anything Blocking?

> Some of the events reference a fraternity with id PDP which doesn't exist so I can null reference errors but that should be solved once the team leader takes a look at the call.

## Notes

> Excited to start up RCOS again
