## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I added all of the panels to link to all of the fraternities on campus

## This Week's Plan

> Work on profile page for each fraternity (I don't want to make one for each so I'm going to make it dynamic somehow)

## Anything Blocking?

> Need to learn how to call backend to get fraternity details

## Notes
