## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I spent most of my time preparing for the presentation for the class. My capstone and my operating systems class has picked up a lot so a lot of my time is devoted to that.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to work on a list of showing all the fraternities in the application. This is one of the last features that I want to work on before graduating, which I believe would put the project at a great spot for future semesters.

## Anything Blocking?

> My course load.

## Notes
