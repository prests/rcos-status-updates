For my last update ever I figured I would go for a more paragraph form and talk about my year in RCOS and RushMe. I started RCOS last semester with not knowledge of the class prior and when I joined I had no idea what I wanted to work on or even what type of coding I wanted to do. I joined RushMe because of my invovlement with Greek Life and I could not be more happy with my decision. I started doing coding for Android and felt like I was taking a new Computer Science course. While I had experience with Java I never had experience coding for a mobile application, and it showed.
 
 It took me about two month just to get familiar with Android Studio and the formating of such a rigid class hierarchy. I started learning about activities and xml files which drive the design for each page in an app. During this time a lot of my code was very hard coded but this wasn't going to work with RushMe's constantly changing data.
 
From there I started learning about Asyncronous tasks and how to make calls to download information from the web. Through this I was able to get up to date information about fraternities and events and display them in real time.

After I started working with the calendar plugin to give a better depiction of when events were, how many events were in a day, and who was hosting the events. This could be displayed by either a weeky by week view or month by month.

The Last two features that I worked on were a detailed page for fraternities that a use could click on to see more about a fraternities description and photos, as well as, a list of all the fraternities that was arranged in a random order for fairness.

Since I was the Android team lead during my second semester a large portion of my time was spent documentating our code base so future semesters would have a shorter learning curve than I did. We did mainly coding, google docs, and diagrams.
  
Overall RCOS has taught me a lot about how to be a better programmer. I went from coding just to get a homework or project done to coding to make a platform last forever.
