## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Worked on profile page for fraternity. I worked mainly on the XML file the is used to structure all the different entities on a page. Right now it's fairly static because I haven't made any of the classes for the app. The goal of this is to be able to make one call when the app is loading to get all the data for the page. I am still fairly new to android studio so this may prove troublesome. I added placeholders where all the data should be so when I do get connected to the backend It will just fill the spots that it was allocated. This has definetly helped me learn more about connecting XML with my actual java code.

## This Week's Plan

> Going to make a fraternity class so we call call the JSON object and have it just pump out classes in a factory

## Anything Blocking?

> Need to learn how to call backend to get fraternity details. Need to learn more about classes

## Notes

> It's been a while since I've done any real java coding...
