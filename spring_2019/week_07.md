## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on creating a UML diagram for how the Android application works. The goal of this will be for when future semesters work on the project and have errors they can see back to the UML diagram to see what interacts with what. It will also be useful when people want to add new features and they want to see where/why to add it where they do.

## This Week's Plan

> After my operating systems exam I plan to go back to the codebase and work on internal storage for the android application.

## Anything Blocking?

> This week is exam 2 for operating systems so a lot of my energy is being sent to that.

## Notes

> I keep saying I'm going back to the codebase but I keep running into other things that block me.
